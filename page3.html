      <p>Bayanihan is a traditional Filipino value that emphasizes communal unity, cooperation, and helping one another, especially in times of need. The term originated from the Filipino word bayan, meaning "community" or "nation." Traditionally, it referred to the practice of neighbors coming together to assist a family in moving their home, often by physically carrying a house on bamboo poles to a new location. This spirit of selflessness and collective effort transcends physical tasks and is applied in various aspects of life, including times of disaster, in which Filipinos rally together to support each other. At its core, bayanihan embodies solidarity, compassion, and the importance of community in overcoming challenges.</p>

This event is often seen as a way to seek the approval of the bride's parents and to establish a relationship between the two families. It is typically marked by a respectful and serious conversation, where the groom expresses his intentions, and both families discuss wedding plans, dowries, and other significant details.

	  <p>A boodle fight is a popular Filipino communal feast where food is spread out on a long table, typically without plates or utensils, and people eat together by using their hands. The meal often consists of a variety of traditional Filipino dishes such as rice, grilled meats, fish, vegetables, and fruits, arranged in a colorful and abundant spread. The term "boodle" is believed to have originated from the American military term "boodle," meaning a collection of food, which was later adapted into Filipino culture. *Boodle fights* are often held during celebrations, gatherings, or team-building activities, emphasizing camaraderie and unity. It fosters a sense of community as everyone shares the same food, and eating by hand is seen as a way to create a closer, more personal connection with others.</p>
